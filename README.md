## Objective
To present the design documents and diagrams generated from the analysis and design of AELMS a microservices based application with the capacity to store, present and manage databases of the ancient Egyptian linguistic resources (glyphs, words, pronunciations, definitions, sample-sentences, classics, classic-lines, and so on). This presentation describes the why (Business Requirement specification), what (System Requirement Specification), and how (System Design Specification) of the AELMS. The presentation also includes a hint of the agile-scrum project management framework required to begine the first four sprints with stories and tasks pulled from a on-going product backlog.
